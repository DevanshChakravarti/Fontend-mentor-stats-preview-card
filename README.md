### What I learned

how _linear-gradient()_ used with _images_ using _CSS background property_ and _linear-gradient()_ is not only use for to make gradient background, with images it can enhance image look.

```css
.img {
  background: linear-gradient(rgba(106, 5, 170, 0.6), rgba(106, 5, 170, 0.6)),
    url("./images/image-header-desktop.jpg");
}
```

### Continued development

Before this challange I have never used filter or overlay color on images. All website UI development I have done have normal images. And going to use this feature from now to make background or card make attractive.
